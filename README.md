## About the project

> _The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use signal functions._
